                    <h1>About Freedom Fighter</h1>
                    <p>One cannot emphasize enough on the importance of freedom fighters. After all, 
                        they are the ones because of whom we celebrate Independence Day. No matter how small a role they played, 
                        they are very much significant today as they were in those times. Moreover, they revolted against the 
                        colonizers so as to stand up for the country and its people.

                    </p> <p>   Furthermore, most of the freedom fighters even went to war to safeguard the freedom of their people. 
                        It did not matter that they had no training; they did it for the pure intention of making their country free.
                        Most of the freedom fighters sacrificed their lives in the war for independence.
                    </p><p>
                        Most importantly, freedom fighters inspired and motivated others to fight injustice. 
                        They are the pillars behind the freedom movement. They made people aware of their rights and their power. 
                        It is all because of the freedom fighters that we prospered into a free country free from any kind of 
                        colonizers or injustice.</p>

                    <h1> Indian Freedom Movements </h1>
                    <p>
                        Indian Freedom Movements are evidence of the year-long freedom struggle of Indian people to get complete 
                        independence. The Indian Freedom Movement started in 1857 with the Revolt of 1857 and ended with achieving 
                        the Independence of India in 1947.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several movements were unsuccessful however, they were powerful enough to move the roots of the British 
                        Government in India. The ultimate goal of all the freedom movements was to get complete independence 
                        from British rule </p>
